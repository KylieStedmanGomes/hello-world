# hello-world
just learning GitHub repositories

## first time _githubber_ learning about *markup* 

I thought an asterisk denoted bold
maybe it needs **two** asterisks ... looks like it

also appears that two returns are required to separate lines from each other

now how about __underline__

and _***underline bold italics***_

no underline does not work according to the rules in markdown text 101

doesn't seem to be underline but there is ~~strikethrough~~
